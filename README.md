# OCRAllInOneSystem

This is a project that aims to reproduce the "All In One System Model" in Modelica (OpenIPSL) and add over current relays for different stability scenarios. This includes a version with all OpenIPSL/PSSE components and one with all OpenIPSL/PSAT components.

It also contains a simple MatLab script to figure out different type relay trip time and a custom copy of the OpenIPSL library.
